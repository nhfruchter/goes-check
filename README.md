# Update
This tool has been deprecated now that DHS is using a different application system.

A tool for a very specific problem (and for learning more about PushBullet).

Are you impatient? Did you apply for Global Entry? Get a push notification when your application status changes on your phone.

Get [PushBullet](http://pushbullet.com), get your API key, and fill in your GOES username and password. Set it to run on a scheduled interval (I chose once a day using Heroku).
